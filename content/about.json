        "My name's Vikram. I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",
        "My current research interests are quite broad, encompassing a wide spectrum of interdisciplinarity. Central to my focus is the application of network science and its methodologies across various domains such as social science and computational biology. I also have another interest in high-performance and scientific computing. I enjoy using multithreading and parallelism to accelerate computation involved in the aforementioned areas.",

        "I enjoy longboarding. I am also learning how to ride a horse, and I've been pretty consistent with that as well! I speak four languages with varying proficiency: English (I'll leave it up to you to judge), Telugu (my mother tongue), Japanese (I lived in Japan for a while), and Spanish (I took a few classes in college).",
