        "<b>Research Interests</b>: I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. George Chacko, with guidance from Prof. Tandy Warnow. I'm interested in problems in <b>network science</b> (<b>graph theory</b>, <b>social networks</b>, etc.) and more recently, <b>natural language processing (NLP)</b>. I've been working with using techniques from the aforementioned areas to study information diffusion and community formation across a variety of social networks. My core work in my group prior to the introduction of NLP has been in developing scalable algorithms for analyzing large-scale networks, with applications in social biological networks.",
