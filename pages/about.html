                    My name is Vikram, and I am an undergraduate in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in mathematics and computer science.
                    I am really fascinated by user experiences, how they look, and how they can be interacted with by different people.

                    Yes, in fact they did a while ago! Other technologies that I find interesting are Google Spoon and PurpleMail. Technology for health is a really fascinating topic. As such, my research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Bioinformatics/Health Informatics.

                    I have a pintail longboard that I originally just rode because campus is pretty big and I needed convenience. Off late though, I've been having fun seeing it more as an ~A R T~, I learned a few tricks and maneuvers and I hope to keep learning. I also recently learned how to ride a horse this past summer and it has been quite the experience. I felt like a ~B A D A S S~, but then I would go home, a full reset would happen and I'd go to sleep.
