                    <p class="card-text">Writing and I have a weird relationship. Whenever I had some sort of "x-word" assignment for school or whatever, it was a major pain in the ass to get that word count up. Add a quote here, repeat the word "really" an extra number of times because that emphasis holds a lot of value for what I'm trying to say (ofc).</p>
                    <p class="card-text">The truth of the matter is that having a deadline or having constraints like things I need to talk about (I got a call home for saying the 'h-word' in my essay back in seventh grade snfvjsbrvjbslbv), writing just becomes less enjoyable. My goal here is to just throw a bunch of crap together and call it writing because you know what? It wasn't dreadful writing this blurb.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">So please come back and visit the page, not only because I'll put more of these up, but because if I search my name on Google (narcissism at intense levels) my Soundcloud comes up before this page and I can't even rap.</p>
