                    Currently, under the guidance of Prof. George Chacko and Prof. Tandy Warnow, I am working with large networks of research papers linked through citation. The largest network I have worked with was a citation network of ~75 million nodes and ~1 billion edges (OpenCitations). The specific projects I'm working on are below:
                    <ul>
                        <li>High-performance well-connected community detection (<a href="https://github.com/illinois-or-research-analytics/cm_pipeline">link</a>)</li>

                    George Chacko has a data repository in progress called Citation Rats. As of now, it contains information on a citation network constructed around the study of Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase, an enzyme involved with cell growth and cancer. I have been using this network for my analyses. Feel free to check it out <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/chackogroup/citation_rats?authuser=0">here</a>!

                </p>
                <p class="card-text">I have also been working with Prof. Mohammed El-Kebir on using clonal trees inferred from variant allele frequencies (VAFs) to infer anatomic labelings of nodes in the clonal tree and ultimately a migration graph. Since his paper on <a href="https://github.com/raphael-group/machina">MACHINA</a> in 2018, we have expanded the solution space to return multiple possible migration histories per primary tumor location.</p>
                <p class="card-text">I created this <a href="https://elkebir-group.github.io/mach2-viz/#/">visualizer</a>. More than simply providing visual aid for the algorithm, it allows users (researchers, oncologists, etc.) to filter through the solution space and enforce priors such as known migrations and/or absences of migrations.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Cyclicity analysis is the technique of aggregating regional linear time series to map spread of a signal over a medium. Cyclicity analysis was traditionally used in neuroscience to infer spread of a signal across the brain given individual synaptic potentials.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">However, we now use Cyclicity Analysis to understand the spread of different variants of COVID. Using American and Canadian provincial COVID case time series, spread is mapped across North America.</p>
